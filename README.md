# ChromaCloset
ChromaCloset is an application that generates color-coordinated outfits based on the real-time temperature of a location
in the United States. Outfits are generated with items of clothing that the user inputs and that are stored by the
application. Outfits may be generated as many times as the user would like. The user will input a ZIP code for the location, which can be changed at any time.

## Executing ChromaCloset
I would like to create an executable, although if I am unable to, PySimpleGUI will need to be installed to run the program. An API used to obtain temperature data will be implemented, so an internet connection is required to generate outfits.
