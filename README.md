# ChromaCloset
ChromaCloset is an application that randomly generates color-coordinated outfits with two or three clothing items. Outfits are generated with items of clothing that the user inputs and that are stored by the application. The user chooses whether they would like cool (<70 degrees Fahrenheit) or warm (>= 70 degrees Fahrenheit) weather outfits, and outfits may be generated as many times as the user would like.

## Executing ChromaCloset
After installing PySimpleGUI, please run Main.py.
